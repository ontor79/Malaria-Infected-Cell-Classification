# Malaria-Infected-Cell-Classification

# This Deep Learning model shows how we can classify malaria infected cells from a bunch of images and deploy it in a simple dashboard.

Deep learning methods achieve impressive performance (even surpassing human-level performance) in several tasks over a wide spectrum of domains. However, in many domains like healthcare, reasoning the predictions of a model is vital. They are useful in evaluating the reliability and fairness of a model, and in effective data-driven decision making.

While being a generally black box approach, with modern techniques, deep learning methods can provide some explanations to their predictions. In the context of image classification, heat-maps on the image highlighting areas that highly influence the classification of the target can be generated (see examples below).
